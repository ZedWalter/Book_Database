# Overview

This is a program I wrote to keep track of the books I have read and the overall score that I would place on them. If you are familiar with MyAnimeList, I created this program to function similarly to that. I wrote this program because I wanted to learn how to intergrate SQL commands into Python code and use a database straight from the editor. The program currently only has 1 table to store the book information, once you launch the program it will provide you with a list of options and prompts depending on which option you pick.

# Relational Database

Right now this is using the Sqlite3 library within python that runs using SQL commands.
Currently there is only 1 table that holds information.
